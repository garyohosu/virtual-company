# ✅ Codex CLI Execution Result

**Task**: Sakura FreeBSD 修正 (wheel 版)
**Date**: 2026-01-31T06:55:49.1365147+09:00
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

## Summary
Executed wheel-only install flow on Sakura; pydantic-core wheel unavailable on FreeBSD so dependencies and tests remain blocked. Setup summary was generated and copied to the server.

## What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Ran wheel-only dependency install attempt
- ✅ Import checks attempted
- ⚠️ pydantic-core==2.14.0 wheel not found; install failed
- ⚠️ DB init failed (scripts.init_db not found)
- ⚠️ pytest not installed; tests failed
- ⚠️ Gunicorn UvicornWorker failed (uvicorn missing)
- ✅ SETUP_FIX_COMPLETE.txt created via SCP using remote date/host

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Partial (dependency install blocked)
- Compliance: 55%
- Issues: 5

## Next Steps
👉 CEO should decide on compatible pydantic-core wheel (or upgrade Python/OS) and re-run this order after dependency resolution.
