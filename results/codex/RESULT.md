# ? Codex CLI Execution Result

**Task**: MagicBoxAI テスト/起動
**Date**: 2026-01-31T05:32:27.0697138+09:00
**Status**: ?? PARTIAL

## Summary
Ran dependency install, test suite, DB init, app startup attempt, and API verification. Tests and standard app startup are blocked by dependency/logging issues.

## What Was Accomplished
- ? Installed dependencies from requirements.txt (with noted conflict)
- ?? Pytest run completed with 4 failures (TestClient/httpx mismatch)
- ? Database initialization completed
- ?? python -m magicboxai.main startup failed due to logging formatter error (DualWriter lacks isatty)
- ?? API verification completed in-process; /api/health returned 404, /api/check-limit OK
- ? Logs and readiness checklist written to results/codex

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Medium (runtime blockers present)
- Compliance: 70%
- Issues: 3 (tests, startup, health endpoint)

## Next Steps
?? Gemini CLI should review failures and recommend fixes for logging/TestClient compatibility.
