# ? Codex CLI Execution Result

**Task**: MagicBoxAI 3 fixes (order_magicboxai_èCê≥.md)
**Date**: 2026-01-31T05:42:52.9491947+09:00
**Status**: ?? PARTIAL

## Summary
Applied the three requested fixes and verified the API endpoints locally. Pytest still fails due to DB tables not created when TestClient is used without lifespan startup.

## What Was Accomplished
- ? Added GET `/api/health` endpoint
- ? Added `DualWriter.isatty()` to logging
- ? Pinned `httpx==0.25.1`
- ? Local API verification for `/api/health`, `/api/check-limit`, `/api/save`
- ?? Pytest still failing (3/4 tests) due to missing `track_limit_daily` table in TestClient context

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Medium (tests failing)
- Compliance: 80%
- Issues: 1 (DB init during TestClient)

## Next Steps
?? Gemini CLI should review the remaining test failure and advise on DB initialization for TestClient/lifespan.
