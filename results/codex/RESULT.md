# ✅ Codex CLI Execution Result

**Task**: Sakura FreeBSD Python 3.8 互換版
**Date**: 2026-01-31T07:01:36.2877402+09:00
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

## Summary
Executed the Python 3.8 compatibility order, but dependency resolution failed (fastapi 0.100.0 vs pydantic 2.0.0), so imports, DB init, tests, and gunicorn startup could not complete.

## What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Python 3.8 verified on Sakura
- ✅ Attempted dependency install for Python 3.8 compatible versions
- ⚠️ Dependency conflict prevented installs (ResolutionImpossible)
- ⚠️ fastapi/uvicorn/pytest not installed; imports failed
- ⚠️ scripts/ directory missing; DB init failed
- ⚠️ pytest tests did not run
- ⚠️ Gunicorn UvicornWorker failed (uvicorn missing)
- ✅ SETUP_PYTHON38_COMPLETE.txt created on server via SCP

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Partial (dependency conflict)
- Compliance: 50%
- Issues: 6

## Next Steps
👉 CEO should choose compatible fastapi/pydantic versions for Python 3.8 (or adjust the stack), then re-run this order.
