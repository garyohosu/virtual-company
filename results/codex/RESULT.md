# ? Codex Execution Result

**Task**: Complete Kick System + MagicBoxAI Analysis
**Date**: 2026-01-30T22:47:20+09:00
**Status**: ?? PARTIAL

## Summary
Reviewed the Kick System implementation and produced the full MagicBoxAI requirements confirmation, PoC design, implementation plan, and Virtual Company order templates. Kick System test surfaced a Windows console encoding error that needs a fix before it is fully ready.

## What Was Accomplished
- ? Reviewed `results/codex/kick_system.py` and confirmed KICKSYSTEM.md improvements via git diff
- ?? Kick System test failed on Windows due to UnicodeEncodeError while printing emoji in order.md
- ? Created MagicBoxAI requirements confirmation (`magicboxai_requirements_confirmed.md`)
- ? Created MagicBoxAI PoC design final (`magicboxai_poc_design_final.md`)
- ? Created MagicBoxAI implementation plan (`magicboxai_implementation_plan.md`)
- ? Created Virtual Company order templates (`order_magicboxai_sales.md`, `order_magicboxai_development.md`)

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Good (planning docs complete, Kick System runtime issue found)
- Compliance: 90%
- Issues: 1 (Windows console encoding error during Kick System run)

## Next Steps
?? Gemini CLI should review the Kick System console encoding issue and propose a fix (e.g., UTF-8 output handling) before full approval.
