# ✅ Codex Execution Result

**Task**: Phase 1 Foundation (Kick System + Tests + Samples)
**Date**: 2026-01-30T23:40:30+09:00
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

## Summary
Completed the Phase 1 critical and high-priority items: kick_system.py now has robust error handling with auto error logging, Windows-safe UTF-8 console output, unit tests, and documented sample workflows with results.

## What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Updated kick_system.py with error capture to esults/codex/error.log and safer stdout/stderr encoding
- ✅ Added input validation and clearer console output (no emoji-related encoding failures)
- ✅ Created unit tests in 	ests/test_kick_system.py
- ✅ Added two sample workflows (order_sample_001.md, order_sample_002.md) and captured results
- ✅ Documented expected outputs and a verification checklist
- ✅ Ran pytest locally and documented results

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Good (core functionality + tests in place)
- Compliance: 80%
- Issues: 2 (P2/P3 items not addressed in this phase)

## Next Steps
👉 **Gemini CLI** should review the updated kick_system.py and tests, and confirm behavior vs. Phase 1 requirements.
