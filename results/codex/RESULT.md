# ✅ Codex CLI Execution Result

**Task**: Sakura FreeBSD 自動セットアップ
**Date**: 2026-01-31T06:35:51.4920850+09:00
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

## Summary
Executed Sakura FreeBSD setup steps via SSH, created venv and setup summary, but dependency install and tests failed due to pip/packaging constraints.

## What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Venv created and Python verified on Sakura
- ✅ Gunicorn installed and version verified
- ✅ Setup summary generated on server and captured locally
- ⚠️ Requirements install failed (pydantic-core build requires Rust / setuptools-rust)
- ⚠️ DB init and pytest failed due to missing dependencies
- ⚠️ Gunicorn UvicornWorker failed due to missing uvicorn

## Key Metrics
- Quality: Partial (dependency install blocked)
- Compliance: 60%
- Issues: 4

## Next Steps
👉 CEO will now decide whether to update Python/pip toolchain or install Rust to satisfy pydantic-core build, then re-run setup.
