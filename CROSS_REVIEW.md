# Cross Review

## Codex Outputs
- [x] Documentation consolidated correctly (`docs_consolidated.md` created)
- [x] No critical content lost (index points to all core docs)
- [x] Git standards reasonable (`GIT_STANDARDS.md` created)
- Comments: Consolidation identifies source-of-truth and legacy artifacts.

## Claude Code Outputs
- [x] Security checklist comprehensive for CLI scope (`SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`)
- [x] Scalability methodology valid (mock orgs, timing recorded)
- [x] Recommendations practical and actionable
- Comments: Memory usage not measured; noted as a future improvement.

## Gemini Outputs
- [x] `requirements.txt` versions pinned
- [x] `SETUP.md` clear with notes about placeholders
- [x] Code quality standards appropriate (`CODE_QUALITY_REVIEW.md`)
- Comments: Setup doc flags missing modules gracefully.

## Overall Coherence
- Artifacts are consistent and aligned with Phase 2/P3 requirements.
- No blocking inconsistencies found.
