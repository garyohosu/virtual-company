# Error Pattern 008 - pip dependency conflict (ResolutionImpossible)

## What Happened
pip failed with ResolutionImpossible when installing fastapi==0.100.0 and pydantic==2.0.0 due to incompatible requirements.

## Why It Happened
The pinned versions have conflicting dependency constraints (fastapi 0.100.0 does not support pydantic 2.0.0).

## Prevention
- Check package compatibility matrix before pinning versions.
- Use pip to resolve without strict pins, then lock compatible versions.

## Solution Steps
1. Relax or adjust pins (e.g., align fastapi and pydantic supported ranges).
2. Re-run pip install.
3. Record the working versions in requirements.txt.
