# Error Pattern 006 - pip install fails for pydantic-core (Rust build / setuptools-rust not available)

## What Happened
pip install -r requirements.txt failed while building pydantic-core via maturin. Errors included missing setuptools-rust versions and missing Rust compiler.

## Why It Happened
- The environment attempted to build pydantic-core from source (no compatible wheel).
- Rust toolchain was not available.
- pip resolved to system site-packages (pip 21.0.1) instead of venv pip, reducing compatibility.

## Prevention
- Ensure the venv uses its own pip (venv/bin/pip) and is upgraded.
- Use a Python version with available wheels for pydantic-core on FreeBSD.
- Install Rust toolchain if source builds are required.

## Solution Steps
1. Verify venv pip path: which pip and pip --version.
2. Upgrade venv pip explicitly: /home/garyo/magic-box-ai/venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip.
3. If still building from source, install Rust (via package manager or rustup).
4. Re-run pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Related Errors
- Error Pattern 004 (missing git config)

## References
- requirements.txt uses pydantic 2.x which depends on pydantic-core.
