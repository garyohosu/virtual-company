# Error Pattern 007 - git push rejected (fetch first)

## What Happened
git push failed with "fetch first" because remote had new commits.

## Why It Happened
Another actor pushed to the same branch after the last pull.

## Prevention
- Always run git pull --rebase before pushing.
- Coordinate pushes if multiple agents are active.

## Solution Steps
1. Run git pull --rebase.
2. Resolve any conflicts.
3. Re-run git push.
